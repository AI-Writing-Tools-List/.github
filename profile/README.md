<h1>AI Writing Tools List – Curated list of Artificial Intelligence Tools for Content Creation</h1>

<p>We just curated a list of the best AI tools for writing based on hands-on testing and real performance, starting from the best-performing writer down to the least useful. Each tool was evaluated on quality, usability, pricing, and how well it handled buyer-intent, informational, and comparison content.</p>

<h2>1. Koala</h2>
<p>Koala ranked as the top-performing AI writer in this hands-on comparison. It excels at buyer guides, especially for affiliate-focused content. Its Amazon-style product roundups performed extremely well in both SEO and readability. Starting at just $9/month with generous per-article pricing (as low as $0.80), it’s both affordable and scalable. It handled structured articles effortlessly and produced polished, publish-ready drafts. The user experience is straightforward, and its SEO results in real-world testing were impressive — content was already ranking on test sites. Highly recommended for affiliate sites, blogs, and marketers who want minimal effort with high output.</p>

<h2>2. AutoBlogging.ai</h2>
<p>AutoBlogging.ai came in second, particularly strong for informational content. The standout feature is its “God Mode,” which significantly improves content quality. While the standard writer underperformed, enabling God Mode changed the game. At ~$0.49–$0.80 per article, it’s competitively priced, and monthly plans start at $49. Despite a plain interface and lack of polish, it generates well-structured, SEO-friendly articles that ranked well in testing. It’s a great option for content farms, niche sites, or those who want to scale up bulk content production quickly and efficiently — provided you're using the upgraded writing mode.</p>

<h2>3. SEOWriting.ai</h2>
<p>A strong all-rounder, SEOWriting.ai is extremely affordable at just $12/month with articles costing only ~$0.24. It performed consistently across all content types, scoring similarly high on both buyer and informational keywords. What makes it unique is its bulk publishing features — ideal for churning out large volumes of content for niche sites or SEO projects. It’s lightweight, easy to use, and produces decently optimized drafts. However, it’s not as refined or creative as others, and it might require minor editing to hit a professional tone. Still, it’s arguably the best value-for-money writer on this list.</p>

<h2>4. Scalenut</h2>
<p>Scalenut was a surprising entry in the top five. Known for its clean UI and accessible pricing ($39/month), it punches above its weight in performance. Buyer-intent content stood out the most, with scores among the highest tested. Informational content was also solid, though slightly less consistent. Its combination of speed, SEO readiness, and cost-effectiveness (about $0.80/article) makes it a serious contender for bloggers and digital marketers. It may not have the flashiest features, but for practical users who want results over novelty, Scalenut holds its own against more expensive competitors.</p>

<h2>5. Kappa.sh (Cuppa)</h2>
<p>Kappa.sh is a bring-your-own-API tool that impressed on its informational output. Priced at ~$140/year (or ~$12/month), it’s an excellent low-cost solution for tech-savvy users willing to integrate their own OpenAI key. It’s not ideal for buyer guides, which came in weaker, but informational content scored among the best in the entire test. Despite a clunky interface, the tool offers huge output potential if you're comfortable handling the setup. Recommended for developers or content creators who prefer flexibility and want to manage long-term costs efficiently while still generating useful, optimized text.</p>

<h2>6. OnPage.ai</h2>
<p>OnPage.ai markets itself as an “undetectable” AI writer. It performed well on informational keywords, producing strong and readable content, though it lagged slightly on buyer guides. Articles cost around $24, with a steep $240/month subscription. The pricing model is restrictive for solo creators or budget-conscious users. While quality is decent, the premium price tag only makes sense for serious SEO professionals or agencies with a need for “stealth” content that avoids detection tools. Otherwise, there are cheaper options that provide equal or better quality. Still, the tech is intriguing and deserves attention.</p>

<h2>7. Copymatic</h2>
<p>Copymatic is one of the most budget-friendly options on this list — just $19/month for unlimited usage. Its output was clean and reasonably SEO-friendly, especially for buyer keywords. Articles were readable and mostly coherent, though they occasionally drifted into repetitive or vague territory. At this price point, it’s a strong choice for PBN owners, content farms, or anyone producing volume-driven SEO content. Don’t expect perfect polish or creativity, but if you’re after cheap, bulk content that passes basic SEO checks, Copymatic delivers excellent value with minimal fuss.</p>

<h2>8. Content at Scale</h2>
<p>Content at Scale is among the most expensive tools tested, starting at $500/month with articles priced around $25. That said, it performed quite well for informational keywords and produced longer, better-structured articles than most. While buyer-intent content underwhelmed, the articles felt human-written and had a natural flow. It’s suited for agencies or high-budget content operations looking to automate long-form blog posts. The tool isn't beginner-friendly, and its cost makes it impractical for most indie creators. But for scaling large blogs with minimal hands-on editing, it can be a powerful asset.</p>

<h2>9. Agility Writer</h2>
<p>Agility Writer was surprisingly effective, despite flying under the radar. With plans from $25/month and articles costing ~$0.80, it offers strong customization features for tailoring article structure and tone. While SEO scores weren’t top-tier, it produced well-balanced articles with solid informational value. Buyer guides were passable, though not a standout. Its real strength lies in its advanced options and flexibility — ideal for users who want to fine-tune outputs rather than rely on one-click generation. Worth testing in specific niches to see if it fits your workflow.</p>

<h2>10. Wordplay.ai</h2>
<p>Wordplay has one of the only lifetime deals still available in the AI writing world. For ~$100, you can get about three articles/month, with larger plans offering better value. The quality is hit or miss, but informational articles were its strongest output. Buyer guides were mediocre. Given the pricing model, it’s more of a niche tool for casual users looking to supplement their content strategy. If you don’t need constant output and want a one-time investment option, Wordplay might be the low-maintenance writing tool you’re looking for.</p>
<h2>11. ContentSprout</h2>
<p>ContentSprout was not a standout. It forces users to generate a “topical map” before accessing the actual writing functionality — a confusing barrier that adds time and cost. Each map uses credits, and the effective cost per article comes out to ~$7.40. At $97/month, it’s one of the priciest tools without the performance to back it up. SEO scores were mid-tier at best, and while the articles were structurally sound, they didn’t offer any real edge. The platform feels overcomplicated and overpriced for solo creators or content marketers.</p>

<h2>12. Byword.ai</h2>
<p>Byword.ai became popular thanks to viral success stories, but this test suggested that performance was more tied to domain authority than writing quality. At $100/month and $4 per article, it’s expensive — especially considering average SEO scores and mediocre buyer-intent content. Informational keywords performed slightly better, but not enough to justify the high cost. It’s easy to use, and bulk features are nice, but unless you have an existing high-DA site to support the content, you’ll likely see limited ROI from this tool.</p>

<h2>13. ZimmWriter</h2>
<p>ZimmWriter is affordable (around $10/month) and uses GPT-4 to generate lengthy content (2000+ words). It performed decently in SEO scoring, especially on informational keywords. However, it only works on Windows, which creates a barrier for Mac/Linux users. You may also need a third-party setup to get started. It’s a DIY-friendly option for those who don’t mind jumping through a few hoops, but for most users, the technical requirements and average content quality make this a backup choice rather than a go-to platform.</p>

<h2>14. DraftHorse AI</h2>
<p>DraftHorse AI, created by a well-known Twitter founder, promises high-quality content but failed to deliver in testing. At $49/month and $1 per article, its SEO scores were underwhelming — particularly for buyer-intent content. Informational keywords were somewhat better but still lacked the polish of higher-ranking tools. The platform offers a clean UI and decent support, but performance did not live up to the price. It may improve over time, but in its current state, it’s hard to recommend for serious SEO-focused writing.</p>

<h2>15. HumanWriter</h2>
<p>HumanWriter is an unusual, bring-your-own-API option that’s entirely free. It’s rough around the edges, with a minimal interface and limited guidance, but it managed to outperform several paid tools in raw SEO score. Buyer-intent and info keywords both landed in the low 50s. While it’s buggy and likely too technical for casual users, the fact that it’s free makes it worth a test. If you’re a developer or someone comfortable with APIs, it could be a surprisingly solid option for low-cost AI content production.</p>

<h2>16. Outranking.io</h2>
<p>Outranking.io has an overwhelming UX and was one of the most frustrating tools to use in the test. It took over 20 minutes to generate a single article and had frequent errors. The tool overproduced — spitting out 30,000-word novels instead of targeted blog posts. Despite all this, its content did score reasonably well on SEO metrics. However, at $69/month for just 10 articles (~$7/article), it’s hard to justify. The value-to-time ratio is poor, and unless you want bloated content, this tool is a pass for most.</p>

<h2>17. Trolly AI</h2>
<p>Trolly AI is a newer tool that showed some promise, but ultimately it wasn’t ready for prime time. SEO scores were slightly below average, and content felt generic and uninspired. At $29/month and ~$0.48 per article, it’s not overpriced, but other tools in the same range simply performed better. It may improve with more development, but at this stage, it’s hard to recommend unless you’re curious about supporting a growing project. For production content, it’s still a pass.</p>

<h2>18. WriteSonic</h2>
<p>WriteSonic is well-known and priced at $49/month, with costs coming down to about $0.16/article. While the tool is fast and easy to use, its content wasn’t very SEO-friendly. Buyer intent articles scored low, and informational content was only slightly better. It’s good for quick drafts or social content, but not for serious blog or affiliate SEO work. Overall, the writing felt fluffy and lacked depth. If you’re focused on keyword rankings or detailed content, there are much stronger alternatives on this list.</p>

<h2>19. Copy.ai</h2>
<p>Copy.ai is another big-name tool that underwhelmed in real-world testing. At $36/month for unlimited usage, it might seem like a good deal — but the content didn’t hold up. SEO scores were low across all keyword types, and the output lacked structure and clarity. While it’s usable for social posts or light ad copy, it fails to deliver long-form or SEO-ready articles. If you're hoping for content that can rank or serve as a strong foundation for a site, this isn’t the tool for you.</p>

<h2>20. ChatGPT (Free)</h2>
<p>While ChatGPT (GPT-4) is an amazing assistant, it’s not a reliable AI writer for SEO-focused articles — at least not without advanced prompting. In default mode, it produced weak articles with average SEO scores. At under $20/month, it's affordable, and for casual users, it’s still one of the most versatile AI tools available. But if your goal is bulk content, affiliate blogging, or comparison posts, the time spent engineering prompts and editing results just isn’t worth it. Great tool — but not for this purpose.</p>

<h2>21. Jasper AI</h2>
<p>Jasper AI is one of the most funded and hyped tools in the space — and one of the most disappointing. Despite its $1B+ valuation, it scored near the bottom in both buyer and informational keyword performance. At $50/month, it offers unlimited words, but the content lacked focus, depth, and keyword optimization. SEO scores averaged 30 — far below par. It's a hard pass for anyone serious about ranking content. Despite its branding and features, it simply doesn’t deliver where it counts.</p>

<h2>22. LongShot.ai</h2>
<p>Dead last on the list, LongShot.ai was the worst performer in nearly every category. It took multiple steps and nearly five minutes to generate a single article — which ended up scoring only 26 on Surfer SEO. At $29/month and ~$0.58 per article, it's neither fast nor effective. The tool feels over-engineered for a very underwhelming result. If you're looking for SEO-optimized articles that require minimal editing, skip this one entirely. There are better free tools out there. This is a no-go.</p>
